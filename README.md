## Union. Logs aggregation made easy.
#### Aggregate your log messages from decoupled applications in an easy plug-and-play manner

##### Based on Redis and PostgreSQL. Requires almost zero configuration.
##### Union provides ability to aggregate, store and monitor logging messages from different Python applications and modules in real time.

#### Getting started
- pip install union

1. Using from Python application

``` python
import union

config = {
  'app': 'union_example'  # your application name
  'level': 'debug',  # top level for logging (look Python logging module documentation for details)
  'stdout': True  # if True then default StreamHandler will be added (to see logging in your app stdout)

  'redis': {
    'host': localhost,  
    'port': 6379,
    'key': 'union'  # this key will be used by Union to forward messages through Redis
  }
}

log = union.set_logger('MyLoggerName', config=config)  # if no name was passed the 'root' logger will be returned
```

set_logger() signature: 

```python
set_logger(name=None, *, config, format_style='%', extra_handlers=None)
```

The object returned by union.set_logger() is an instance of Python logger.
So all the behavior that you might expect from Python logger is there.
Under the hood Union will add a handler to the logger that will allow it to forward
messages to your REDIS server. The Union RedisHandler also uses special Formatter class
that basicaly trasforms all the information Python logger provides to a dict (JSON) object.
It will also add the application name that we defined in the config above.

- Note: The Python logger is a singleton. Therefore Union will restrict setting a logger with the same
  name more then once in runtime. You still can get an instance that is already configured by Union 
  (for example in some submodule of your app) by calling union.get_logger('your logger name').
  ``` python
  log = union.get_logger('MyLoggerName')
  ```
 
- Note: You can add arbitary number of custom handlers along with Union handler by passing them to
  extra_handlers key-value argument.

- Note: In the current version (0.1.1) only '%' formatting style is supported. format_style argument is added 
  in advance for future extensions and should not be used.
  
- Note: Another limitation of version (0.1.1): Python logging 'extra' kwag is not supported yet.
